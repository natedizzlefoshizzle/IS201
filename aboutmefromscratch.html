    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Nate Burden. I love playing video games and going to the gym (in that order). I'm married to my wife and best friend Rylee Holmes, who inspires me daily and gives me the motivation I need to get through the day. Psychology is a subject I've come to love. I would make it mandatory that everyone take the introductory level courses if I could. Learning how to work with others, and better understand why people do what they do, has helped me to not only resolve workplace disputes, but to benefit from them. With the skill set that I've obtained, I find myself motivated to help people work together. I find no greater satisfaction than to magnify one's capabilities through collaboration with other unique skillsets. Project Management is my calling in life. If you wish to know more about me, watch the video below!</p>
